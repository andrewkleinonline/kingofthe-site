# King of the Site

This is a rails app project I am doing for fun and to learn. I will host the
project on http://www.kingofthe.site

The goal is to create a site where users provide their best response to a
creative prompt, vote for their favorite responses, and the user who gets the
most votes becomes "king" and gets to set the next prompt. As a stretch goal, I
would like institutions, organizations, and communities to be able to form their
own groups so they can use in-jokes and not worry about moderation.

To make this app, I used:

* Faker & Factory Girl
* Omniauth-facebook
* Figaro
* Rails

When I am satisfied with the core functionality, I will work on improving the
user experience with React.
